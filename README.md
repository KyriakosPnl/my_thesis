# **Ranking spatio-textual large-scale data based on innovative ways of classification**


With the latest technologies aimed at wireless internet connection through smart phones and the
implementation of more and more actions through them, the need arises for the development of
innovative tools that meet the needs of users. Another important piece of modern technology is the
ability to find the location of each user, as well as the personalization offered by it. Smartphones
offer users the ability to search for points of interest, which are within a certain distance and meet
certain conditions, according to criteria set by the user. These points can be companies that offer
products or services. The purpose of this Thesis is the classification of spatial-textual data that
represent some points of interest, according to the searches performed for them by users from a
specific location. To rank the points of interest, we create a graph, where in combination with rank
algorithms, provide useful conclusions.

# General

This thesis / project was developed at the Information and Comunication Systems Department at the University of the Aegean (Greece).
The main idea was to create a graph based on spatio-textual large scale data, and also use some keywords to define a relationship between the nodes.
After the creation of the graph, we use ranking algorithms, to extract some useful information about the data. The project also provides some extra functionalities, such as:

- Randomly create a log file .
- Display the top-k answers refering to a specific query.
- Import / Export the graph.
- Visualize the final graph.

The implementation is in Java language, and the jgrapht (1.4 version) library (https://jgrapht.org).
